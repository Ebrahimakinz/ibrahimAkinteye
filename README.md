Welcome to my Cyclistic BikeShare Repository

This is for the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project.

PROJECT INFORMATION
===================
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago that in 2016 launched a bike-share program which features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic differentiates itself by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments while offering flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. They categorized customers who purchase single-ride, or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Project Goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members
Business Questions: how annual members and casual riders differ in their use of Cyclistic bikes
		        why casual riders would buy a membership

PREPARE
=======
Source of the data: The last 12 months of Cyclistic trip data was downloaded from divvy-tripdata , and then converted the .csv files to .xlsx. The data range downloaded for use in the project is from July 2021 to June 2022.
Organization of the data: Each of the files have 13 columns of data with the following attributes: ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start and end coordinates, and then member_casual.

Credibility of the data: This comprehensive and regularly updated public data was collected and made available by Motivate, International Inc. under this license. The data is Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited.
Licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility of the data: Due to privacy considerations, the data was stripped of personally identifying information (PII). The lack of identifying information thus limit the extent of possible analysis, for example, there is not enough information to determine how often the casual riders use bike-share.

The data’s ability to answer business questions: There is an attribute in the data that describes the type of rider as casual or member. Casual refers to riders who pay for individual or daily rides while member refer to riders with annual subscription. This will help determine the variation in the use of the bike-share by the two groups.
The problems with the data: The apparent problems are missing fields and duplicate records. 

PROCESS
=======
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was the first tool used to view and clean the data month by month. Even though the data was large, it wasn’t impossible to analyze each month’s data using spreadsheet.
The records were reviewed to better understand the measured values, data formats, and the context. Filter was applied to find blanks, and the data was checked to remove duplicate records. Leading and trailing spaces as well as other inaccuracies and inconsistencies were removed.
